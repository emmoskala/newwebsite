In this section I will conduct an analysis of weather anomalies between
1880 - 2022. The data used in this analysis has been collected by NASA's
Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

Let's have a quick look at the data provided by NASA.

```{r weather_data}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

head(weather)

```

The data gives us the information on the deviation of the temperature
from expected temperature for every month and year between 1880 and
2021.

## Time-series scatter plot 

Let's see what was the dynamic of weather anomalies over years. In order
to create a scatter plot, I need to pivot the table using function
`pivot_longer.`

```{r tidyweather}
weather %>% 
  select(1:13) %>% 
  pivot_longer(2:13, names_to = "month", values_to = "delta") -> tidyweather

```

Now, after creating a new variable `date`, I am able to produce
time-series scatter plot showing a pace of weather anomalies over time.

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         Year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point(color = "darkcyan", alpha = 0.6)+
  geom_smooth(color="black") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather anomalies over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Deviation"
  )

```

Let's have a look at the weather anomalies each month by using
`facet_wrap` function.

```{r facet_wrap}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point(color = "darkcyan", alpha = 0.6)+
  geom_smooth(color="black") +
  facet_wrap(~month) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Deviation"
  )

```

> There is no apparent difference between the effects of increasing
> temperature in monthly data. January and February seem to represent
> the strongest change over time, but it does not vary significantly
> from other months. Therefore, we can conclude that the climate change
> influences deviations in temperature regardless of the month or
> season.

## Density plot of weather anomalies 

Now, let's produce a density plot of weather anomalies for 5 time
periods starting from 1880. In order to do this, I need to create new
variable `interval` using `mutate` function.

```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%    
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))
```

In a next step, I am plotting the graph with `ggplot` package.

```{r density_plot}

comparison %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = delta, fill = interval, color = interval)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  labs (
    title = "Weather anomalies by time interval ",
    x = "Deviation",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "Decade",
    color = "Decade"
  )
```

## Average annual anomalies

We can also create a plot for average yearly anomalies. To produce this
graph, I need to create yearly averages using `group_by` and `summarise`
functions. I am using `loess` method to see the trend over time.

```{r averaging}

average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

average_annual_anomaly %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=mean_delta)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=mean_delta>0)) + # DRAWING POINTS ABOVE ZERO A DIFFERENT COLOUR
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color="black") +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(
    title = "Average weather anomalies by year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average weather anomalies", 
    color = "Is weather anomaly positive?"
  )
```

## Confidence Interval for `delta`

Let's construct confidence interval for weather anomalies since 2011.
First, I will try calculating CI using formula.

#### CI using formula

For starters, I filtered for years 2011 and above. In order to calculate
the confidence intervals, I have calculated for every year many summary
statistics including mean, SD, SE and sample size. Using these summary
statistics I have calculated the t-Student distribution critical value,
and multiplied the `t_critical` by the standard error to get the final
margin of error. Finally I added and subtracted the margin of error to
the mean to get the limits of the interval.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_delta = mean(delta),
    sd_delta = sd(delta),
    count = n(),
    # We're choosing a 95% confidence interval:
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
    se_delta = sd(delta/sqrt(count)),
    margin_of_error = t_critical*se_delta,
    delta_low  = mean_delta - margin_of_error,
    delta_high = mean_delta + margin_of_error
  )
  
formula_ci
```

In order to fully understand the data we I calculated above, here you
can see the following visualization of the mean and confidence
intervals:

```{r}
formula_ci %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.factor(Year)) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(color = Year)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(x=Year, y=mean_delta, ymax=delta_high, ymin=delta_low)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Weather anomalies range by Year",
    subtitle = "NASA Weater Data",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Delta range", 
    color = NULL
  )
```

> The visualization shows an increase in the mean over the years,
> reaching a first maximum in 2016, and an even higher maximum mean in
> 2020. For years with a higher mean delta, the confidence intervals
> seem to increase as well. With the current samples and intervals, we
> cannot say for sure that the mean delta in year 2016 was higher than
> the mean delta in 2017 for instance, but we can be sure with 95%
> confidence that 2011 was lower than 2016.

#### CI using formula (for all years)

Since there are not enough data points every year, the confidence
intervals are very large and vary a lot by year. The total confidence
interval for the entire period is as follows:

```{r}
formula_ci_interval <- comparison %>% 

  filter(Year >= 2011) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  group_by(interval) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_delta = mean(delta),
    sd_delta = sd(delta),
    count = n(),
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
    se_delta = sd(delta/sqrt(count)),
    margin_of_error = t_critical*se_delta,
    delta_low  = mean_delta - margin_of_error,
    delta_high = mean_delta + margin_of_error
  )

formula_ci_interval %>% select(delta_low, delta_high)
```

#### CI using bootstrapping

Finally, we can also calculate the intervals for year 2011 and above
using `bootstraping`:

```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

boot_dist <- comparison %>%
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.factor(Year)) %>%
  specify(response=delta) %>%
  generate(reps=1000, type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

boot_dist %>%
  get_confidence_interval(
    level = 0.95
  )
```
