<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>I was born in Poland on 30.07.1999. My parents, Izabella and Jacek, lived in a small town in southern Poland - Kalwaria Zebrzydowska. That’s where I spent the most of my childhood. After I graduated local primary school, me and my family moved to another city, Krakow, so that I can continue my secondary education.</p>
