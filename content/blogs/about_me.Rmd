## Get to know me

My name is Emilia, I come from Cracow, which is one of the most beautiful cities in Poland. I am a recent graduate of Warsaw School of Economics in Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems. In my free time I enjoy playing tennis and cooking.

## Early life

I was born in Poland on 30.07.1999. My parents, Izabella and Jacek, lived in a small town in southern Poland - Kalwaria Zebrzydowska. That's where I spent the most of my childhood. After I graduated local primary school, me and my family moved to another city, Krakow, so that I can continue my secondary education.

## Education

I continued my education at **August Witkowski Vth High School** in Krakow, where I focused on the following majors:

1)  Mathematics,
2)  Physics,
3)  IT.

After graduating High School, I enrolled [Warsaw School of Economics](https://www.sgh.waw.pl/en), the best economic university in Poland. I pursued *Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems* programme, where I had an opportunity to take up courses elaborating on applications of IT in enterprises.

## Business Background

During my studies, I applied for Deloitte's IT Academy, where I had an opportunity to learn about information systems, integration, IT architecture, and data warehouse. Headhunted by recruiters, I joined Technology Strategy & Transformation at Deloitte Digital.

## London Business School

Through my experience at Deloitte, I realised that I would like to deepen my knowledge on the opportunities posed by digital disruption, and I found MAM curriculum perfectly tailored not only for my professional but also academic interests. Therefore, I decided to continue my education at LBS.
